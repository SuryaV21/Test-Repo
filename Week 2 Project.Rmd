Creation of data frame for passing latitude and longitude values

```{r data frame}
library(leaflet)

df <- data.frame (
lat = c(44.968046,44.33328,33.755787,33.844843,44.92057,44.240309,44.968041,44.333304,33.755783,33.844847,44.920474,44.240304),
lng = c(-94.420307,-89.132008,-116.359998,-116.54911,-93.44786,-91.493619,-94.419696,-89.132027,-116.360066,-116.549069,-93.447851,-91.493768)
)
```


```{r hyperlinks}
link <- c("<a href= 'https://www.eclinicalsol.com'>Eclinical Sol</a>")
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r Map}

df %>%
leaflet () %>%
addTiles()  %>%
addMarkers(popup=link)


```
